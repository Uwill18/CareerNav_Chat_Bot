    <template>Hello! My name is Kendrick. I'm a chat bot, and today I'd like to help you by asking someÂ questions to help you identify which career field best suits you.
I know I'm a robot, but please think of me if you will as a guide, or a brainstorming buddy who is engaged with the journey of helping you find the answers you are looking for.
Ultimately what we leave with today are merely suggestions for you to evaluate when we are done with this chat.
If you don't mind me asking, what is your name?
<think><set name="topic">username</set></think>
<!--<think><set var="username"><get name="name" /></set></think>-->
   <!--<condition var="username">-->
     <!--<li value="unknown">You haven't told me your name yet!</li>-->
   <!--  <li>Your name is <get var="username" />.</li>-->
